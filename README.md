  # Project Proposal
The project objective is to assist job seekers in finding a job. Scraped data will be used to analyse the most popular requirements for certain fields to help job seekers identify which jobs they are qualified for, or necessary skills they may need to obtain.

Every employer uses different terms and words in job listings.

Once we had our data, we utilized a jupyter notebook to clean our data and export it as csv files to use in pgAdmin 4. We also created JSON files so team members could begin working with the data in javascript while our API was being constructed. Once the data was ready, we used pgAdmin 4 to create tables, populate the tables with the appropriate data, and then generate the queries needed for our data analysis. Below is the ERD graph.
