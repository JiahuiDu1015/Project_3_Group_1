# Project_3_Group_1

Project Proposal
The objective of this project is to analyze the salary landscape within the data analytics industry across twelve different countries. The analysis will be conducted by examining various factors, including experience levels, geographical locations, and job titles. Additionally, the project aims to assess and compare the quality of life in each of these countries.
The data sources for this analysis include publicly available salary report of Data Science from Kaggle.

Data sources: 
 1. Data Engineer salaries https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023
 2. Cost of living data from https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/
 3. Lat and long coordinates [Maps.ie](https://www.maps.ie/coordinates.html#:~:text=To%20find%20the%20exact%20GPS,marker%20to%20the%20precise%20position.)

Once we had our data, we utilized a jupyter notebook to clean our data and export it as csv files to use in pgAdmin 4. We also created JSON files so team members could begin working with the data in javascript while our API was being constructed. Once the data was ready, we used pgAdmin 4 to create tables, populate the tables with the appropriate data, and then generate the queries needed for our data analysis. Below is the ERD graph.
